        <h2>The Project</h2>
        <p>This project was built for a renowned airlines and its newly acquired airlines.
          The aim of the project was to make the existing mobile app airline neutral -
          a design that would be based on
          same structure for any number of sub-products and has to be consistent across all the platforms.
        </p>
        <p>
          The app was to be redesigned for all the platforms, viz., mobile web, iOS and Android.

        <h2>The Approach</h2>
        <p>I partnered with the product owner and business analyst to analyse the plan and we decided to
          carry out the project in 4 phases:</p>
        <div class='center pt-1'>
          <img src='../images/airline-neutral-phases.jpg'  />
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class='row pt-2'>
      <div class='col s12'>
        <h4>1. Strategy and Analysis</h4>
        <p>The project aimed at having its first release after 4 months. So, we needed a plan
          that would help us to carry out the 'Airline neutral' project effectively.
        </p>
        <p>In the beginning, we accessed our existing designs and code base. After meetings with tech leads,
          we came to know that
          code base was tightly coupled to the parent airlines. It was  built with the aim of only one airlines, hence
          code was not at all reusable.
        </p>
        <p>So, our first step was to direct the teams, viz., mobile web, Android and iOS, to decouple and refactor the code
          to make it scalable and reusable.
        </p>
        <p>Next, we got some key screens (2-3 in number) of the new airlines UI from the design agency.
           The expectation from the business was to study these key screens and repaint the app for the new airlines.
           The problem was not just repainting, the problem was to build an airline-neutral solution which could scale from the parent app and can accomodate any number of airlines in the future.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class='row pt-2'>
      <div class='col s12'>
        <h4>2. Build repaint directives</h4>
        <p>We had received 2-3 key screens from the design agency consisting of the original app in new brand skin.
          Our task was to create directives based on these designs to create logical transformations that could easily apply
          throughout the application for all platforms, viz., mobile web, Android and iOS.
        </p>
        <p>I partnered with the product owner to analyse those key screens and extracted out some rules.
          We then went through all the screens of the parent mobile web app and analysed how the rules would fit into them.
          After this rigorous exercise, we were able to create a map representing logical transformation of
          foundational styles and components. Example:
        </p>

    </div>
    <div class='row pt-2'>
      <div class='col s12'>
        <h4>3. Repaint mobile web</h4>
        <p>Since I was also the UI developer on the project, I was responsible to refactor and decouple the SASS codebase as well.
          In order to understand the refactoring process in a better way, let’s take a car analogy.
          Let’s take model name called 'Alpha' for the analogy.
        </p>
        <div class='center pt-1'>
          <img src='../images/original-car.jpg' width='400' />
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class='col s12 pt-2'>
        <h6>Inconsistent car components</h6>
        <p>Imagine a scenario in which each and every car of
          model 'Alpha' is different. Every car of the model has its own unique
          steering wheel, motor, etc. These inconsistencies may lead to unnecessary confusion and delays. Also, the maintenance would cost a lot.
        </p>
        <p>Similary, our product had a number of inconsistencies. We jotted down all of them. Few of them were:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>inconsistent use of buttons for primary and secondary action,</li>
          <li>different colour hex values for same colour,</li>
          <li>different colours for links, </li>
          <li>inconsistent design for forms,</li>
          <li>inconsistent alignment issues</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class='col s12 pt-2'>
        <h6>Fixing inconsistencies</h6>
        <p>Next step was to fix these inconsistencies.
        </p>
        <p>
          We worked to remove redundant and inconsistent UI components. We ensured that the
          styles are clean and unambiguous across the mobile web.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, we had 6
          different shades of primary blue. So, we discussed the brand guidelines
          with the marketing team and business and
          removed the ambiguity in the brand blue.
          If the inconsistencies are removed, every component or style becomes unique and independent entity
          which can be easily replaced or used polymorphically.
        </p>
        <p>This is similar to the fact that, if the car mechanic knows
          the model of the car and its parts well,
          he/she can confidently deal with the car, fix any issues and can even replace or optimise something to reduce the cost.
        </p>

      </div>
      <div class='col s12 pt-2'>
        <h6>Extracting out components</h6>
        <p>The car could now be disintegrated into its sub components - brakes, window, steering wheel, etc.
          Each component is unique and independent of each other. Also, each component is made up of sub-components
          which are clearly defined.
        </p>
        <div class='center pt-1'>
          <img src='../images/components.jpg' width='400'/>
        </div>
        <p class='pt-2'>After extraction of all the car components, a skeleton or the wireframe of the car is left.
        </p>
        <div class='center pt-1'>
          <img src='../images/structure-car.png' width='400'/>
        </div>

        <p>
          Our task was to breakdown the product into SASS components.
        Since we had a huge amount of legacy code, we carried a hybrid approach of atomic
        design and component-based depending upon the need of our product.
        </p>

        <p>Then, we carried refactoring of the SASS code to extract out
          atoms, molecules and various UI components.
        </p>
        <p>We extracted out the structure of the product, i.e, layouts, templates,
          etc. - these will remain same for both the airlines.
          Now our task of making components airline-neutral came into picture.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class='col s12 pt-2'>
        <h6>Building a new model</h6>
        <p>
          Next, refactored and reusable SASS components were repainted with the new visual guidelines extracted in the previous phase.
          Since the structure of the car remained the same, the newly styled car components
          can now be used to build up a
          new model of the same car.
        </p>
        <p>
          Similarly, the newly painted SASS components could now be put together into the same layout
          to build a new application.
          In technical terms, the base code now behaved polymorphically according to the airlines.
        </p>

      </div>
      <div class='col s12 pt-2'>
        <h6>Here comes the new model!</h6>
        <p>After putting together the components, we got our new product.
        </p>
        <div class='center pt-1'>
          <img src='../images/new-car.jpg' width='400' />
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class='col s12 pt-2'>
        <h6>Feedback</h6>
        <p>I shared the newly painted and refactored app with the Android and iOS team.
          I translated my approach to the developers and handed them guidelines to carry out the repainting.

        <h4>4. Rebrand Android and iOS</h4>
        <p>After receiving feedback from iOS and Android developers, my aim was to implement these guidelines across both these platforms.
        </p>
        <p>Therefore, I paired with the Android and iOS developers to implement the repainting correctly. We had to ensure that
          the repaint occurs uniformly across all platforms. This helped me to refine the guidelines further and cater to OS-specific needs.
        </p>

      </div>
      <div class='col s12 pt-2'>
        <h6>Visual Regression Testing</h4>
        <p>I partnered with the QA to build up a ruby gem <a href='https://rubygems.org/gems/nakal/versions/1.0.4' target='_blank'>'Nakal'<i class='fas fa-external-link-alt'></i></a>
          to carry out automated visual regression testing of the app.
          This helped us to carry out visual validations for our product while development.
