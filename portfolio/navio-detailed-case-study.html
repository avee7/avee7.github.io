        <h2>The Project</h2>
        <p>
          Navio is a digital platform that accompanies Macmillan Education’s English
           language courses for young learners. It provides teachers with a
           seamless transition between the coursebook and digital teaching
           activities.
        </p>
        <p>
          It also makes learning more engaging for young
          learners who achieve rewards by completing game-based language activities.</p>

        <h2>Designing page faithful zoom</h2>
        <p>The Navio app offered digital experience of the coursebook
          in the class which comprises of 100’s of activities and comprehensions.
          In order to teach effectively in the class, the teachers referred actual
          book page spreads in the classroom in image form on the display screen.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class='row pt-3'>
      <div class='col s12'>
        <h4>The Problem</h4>
        <p>
          The customer support had received several complains about the usability
          of zooming into the book on the screen. Teachers had complains like,
           “I’m not able to zoom into the book on the whiteboard”,
           “Zoom function seem to be not working”, “How can I zoom into the book in the class?”.
        </p>
        <p>
          A solution was required to make this experience of using zoom on “page faithful” books intuitive and easier to use in the classroom.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class='row pt-3'>
      <div class='col s12'>
        <h4>The Solution</h4>
        <p>
          I designed a solution which considered the following factors:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>One arm of the teacher is generally occupied with a book or marker while teaching in a class</li>
          <li>Devices used in the classroom for teaching.</li>
          <li>Different types of input devices - mouse, trackpad and touch-based devices (like tablet, interactive whiteboards)</li>
          <li>Commonly known gestures used these days to zoom</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Below is a UX step-by-step process in action of reaching to a solution. This process is little different from the ideal
        UX process as it considers a number of assumptions and constraints in an non-ideal world.

        <h5>1. Problem Analysis</h5>
        <p>Navio is being used by the teachers in Spain schools. The teachers find that teaching through Navio makes English
          learning more interesting for the students due to hundreds of activites related to the coursebook.
          They generally use laptops to teach which connects to an external display, for example projectors.
          Some of the schools also have interactive whiteboards which allows the students and teachers to use
          the touch screen to do activities.
        </p>
        <p>
          I started my work by understanding the teachers complains to analyse their pain points.
          The gist of the problem was that the zooming feature did not have adequate and clear affordances
          which lead to confused users who thought that the feature is simply 'unusable'.
        </p>
        <p>The interactions left the users frustrated and they lost faith in the execution of the functionality. Hence, the gulfs of evaluation and of execution were too large for the users.
          The problems analysed with the interface were:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The teachers could only use slider to zoom in and out of the image. There were no additional interactions available.</li>
          <li>The hidden functionality to right click and zoom was difficult to use as it posed an extra cognitive load on the teachers.</li>
          <li>The right click zoom changed the image to its maximum zoomed in level, which didn't match with the users' mental model</li>
          <li>The ‘magnifying glass’ mouse cursor was confusing and didn't reveal what the user can actually do.</li>
          <li>The right click interaction failed for a touch-enabled whiteboard.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>2. Market research</h5>
        <p>
          There are many widely-used products (both web based and desktop apps)
           in the market which provide intuitive and almost natural way of zooming.
            My aim was to study how zoom interactions differ in different applications.
        </p>
        <p>Zooming interactions were studied across three different types of apps - slack app, google maps and adobe photoshop.</p>

        <p>Studying and comparing these apps helped me to understand their rational behind the different types of zoom interactions.
          I also got good insights of different mental models, target audience,
          use cases and principles behind designing these interactions.
        </p>
        <p>
           Next, I wrote down zoom interactions provided by our app and related problems.

      <div class='col s12'>
        <h5>3. Solution Design</h5>
        <p>
          My aim was to bridge the gulf of execution and the gulf of evaluation
          so that the interface would correspond with the intentions of the user
           and they would get clear acknowledgement of what just happened.
           Also, I wanted to carry out improvisations based on the existing functionality
           to reduce the development time.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class='col s12 center pt-1'>
        <img src='../images/our-solution.png' width='350'/>
      </div>
      <div class='col s12 pt-2'>
        <p>
          Based on the problem analysis and market research, I started by simplifying the existing functionality by:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Removing the feature to ‘right click’ and zoom on the image as it was completely against the mental model of the user</li>
          <li>Replaced the magnifying glass cursor ( <i class="fas fa-search"></i> ) with a pointer ( <i class="fas fa-mouse-pointer"></i> ) cursor as it was not truly
          showing what can be done with the interface.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The features of the solution on a higher level:</p>
      </div>
      <div class='col s12 pt-2'>
        <h6>Progressive zoom</h6>
        <p>
          The progressive zoom was introduced on the click/tap of the zoom in or out icon on the slider,
          click/tap of the slider track and on the left click on the image.
        </p>
        <div class='center pt-1'>
          <img src='../images/click-with-arrow.gif' width='200'/>
          <div class='img-text'>Source:<a href='//material.io/design/components/sliders.html'> Material Design</a> </div>
        </div>

        <p class='pt-1'>
          The click/tap is similar to a step wise and was based on linear progressive zooming in
          and out. This means - if the user is clicking continuously on the image with the aim to zoom in,
          then he/she has to reach maximum zoomed in level to see the minus
          magnifying glass cursor to zoom out.
        </p>
        <div class='center pt-1'>
          <img src='../images/step-wise-zoom.jpg' width='250' />
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class='col s12 pt-2'>
        <h6>Smooth zoom</h6>
        <p>
          Smooth zoom was based on dragging the slider thumb or by pinching to
          zoom on the trackpad.
        </p>
        <div class='center pt-1'>
          <img src='../images/click-and-drag.gif' width='200'/>

        </div>
        <p class='pt-1'>
          Since, a major number of teachers use trackpads of laptops in
          the classroom, the common gesture of ‘pinch to zoom’ was introduced.
        </p>
        <div class='center pt-1'>
          <img src='../images/pinch-zoom-in-out.jpg' width='500'/>

        </div>
      </div>
      <div class='col s12 pt-2'>
        <h6>Slider State</h6>
        <p>
          The extent of the slider thumb would always reflect the zoomed level of the image.
          The beginning of the slider track indicated the default state of the image.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class='col s12 pt-2'>
        <h6>Panning</h6>
        <p>
          Currently, the cursor was always magnifying glass ( <i class="fas fa-search"></i> ) even while panning.
          So, a 'hand' cursor ( <i class="far fa-hand-paper"></i> ) was introduced while panning to give an
          acknowledgement of this interaction  in action.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class='col s12 pt-2'>
        <h6>Resize image</h6>
        <p>
          While teaching in the class, the teachers found it useful to go
          back to the original image size, therefore, a button was designed to
          allow the teachers to do so with just one click.
        </p>
        <div class='pt-1'>
          <img src='../images/resize-icon.jpg' width='50'/>
        </div>
        <p>
          The choice of the icon was based on the reason that the image would always
          contract to come back to its default size. We were not zooming out
           the image less than its default size based on the assumption that teachers do not
           need to zoom out the book spread less than its default size.

        <h5>4. Technical Feasibility & Dev Feedback</h5>
        <p>
          Since we were working in a distributed team, it was important to communicate the designs
          to the developers before handing over to them for development.
        </p>
        <p>
          We already had the UI designs in Sketch as it was an existing functionality.
          So, I created mid-fidelity mockups to discuss these interactions with the developers
          and get their feedback to understand any technical
          challenges to implement the feature. This helped us to understand technical challenges and feasibility of our design.
        </p>
        <p>
          This also gave me an opportunity to run those interactions with a set of
          power users (developers) and get feedback.
          A question highlighted by a developer was “If the user is clicking on the image to zoom
          it progressively and the cursor is ‘plus magnifying glass’ icon,
          but then the user pinches to zooms out, should the cursor change to ‘minus’ icon?”
        </p>
        <div class='center pt-1'>
          <img src='../images/dev-feedback.jpg' />
        </div>
        <p>
          This simple question helped me to refine my zoom model. If the click on the image provides a linear
          progressive zoom model, then pinching in or out would break that sequential model which might
          lead to the confusion of showing the cursor with "plus" ( <i class="fas fa-search-plus"></i> ) icon
          or a "minus" ( <i class="fas fa-search-minus"></i> ) icon.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class='col s12 m6'>
        <p>
          This helped me to rethink the state of the cursor on various
          interactions. Therefore, I decided to simplify
           the interactions and replace the 'plus/minus' magnifying glass ( <i class="fas fa-search-plus"></i> / <i class="fas fa-search-minus"></i> )
           cursor with the default ( <i class="fas fa-mouse-pointer"></i> ) cursor. Consequently, the ability to
           click on the image to zoom in/out was removed.
        </p>
        <p>
          I refined the interactions and came up with a chart which comprised
          of various interactions of the zoom based on these input devices:
          mouse, trackpad and tablet.

        <p><b>Advantage of the dev feedback:</b> Involving developers early in the design process helped to think from
         all points of view and cater edge  cases. It also helped us to validate
         that we are moving in the right direction in terms of technical feasibility.
         <br />The development team found it to be very productive the way design was communicated.
         They were able to save a lot of time in the end because they didn't need to
         wait for the final design and then give feedback on it.

        <h5>4. Showcase with the Business</h5>
        <p>
          The design was communicated to the internal stakeholders and then external stakeholders using
          the mid-fidelity mockups to get their early feedback on the design before development.
          The solution got a positive response from everyone. The stakeholders expressed the following concerns:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Concern 1:</b>
            They wanted to use mouse wheel for zooming in and out.</li>
          <li>
            <b>Concern 2:</b>
            They wanted to click on the image to zoom to a target area. This problem was addressed by trackpad and touch screen using pinch to zoom but not by mouse.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class='col s12 pt-2'>
        <h6>Addressing concern 1: Introducing 'Scroll to zoom'</h6>
        <p>
          Since the beginning, my aim was to keep the interactions in the solution simple -
          therefore, I wanted the 'scrolling' interaction to be direct - when the user scrolls, the content would scroll.
          But, the stakeholders really liked the Google maps feature of zooming using mouse wheel.
           The development team also expressed their technical limitation to
           implement the ‘pinch to zoom’ interaction for the trackpads for the given timelines.
        </p>
        <p>
           Therefore, taking into account both the <b>technical constraints and the stakeholders
           expectations</b>, I decided to implement the 'mouse wheel' interaction to
           zoom in and out. In order to keep interactions uniform, this 'scroll to zoom'
           interaction was also required to replicate on other input devices,
           for example, on trackpad, the scroll action (2 finger scroll as in MacOS) would zoom the image.
         </p>
         <p>

           But this was not implemented for touch-based devices as during the research, I
           came to know that there is no separate scrolling interaction on a zoomed in
           image for a touch-based device, the user simply pans to reach to the content close by.
         </p>
         <p>
           Therefore, 'pinch to zoom' interaction was flagged as a mandatory function on
           touch-based devices to the development team and for the trackpads it was logged
           as a bug for future sprints.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class='col s12 pt-2'>
        <h6>Addressing concern 2: Zooming on target area using mouse</h6>
        <p>
          The zooming in on target area was provided by trackpad and touch-based device
          users by pinching gesture. But the mouse users found it difficult to zoom into a target area.
        </p>
        <p>
          This second concern was resolved by the introduction of 'mousewheel' inetraction to zoom on a
          target area.
          To add an extra layer of interactivity, a 'double click' (using mouse) or 'double tap' (using trackpad or touch screen)
          was added to zoom progressively on the target area.

        <h5>5. High-fidelity design</h5>
        <p>
          After the feedback from developers and stakehodlers and refining the interactions,
          I refined the mid-fidelity mockups to become high-fidelity mockups which could
          be handed over to the developers. This took less time as we used existing UI screens
          from the Sketch to demonstrate interactions in the previous stages.
        </p>
        <p>The screens and the assets were then handed over to the developers.<p>

        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
        <h6>Assumptions and Constraints</h6>
        <p>
          There were a number of challenges, assumptions and constraints throughout this 2-week sprint
          process:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>We didn't have flexibility in terms of timelines to perform user research in Spain (as this product was used in Spain schools), therefore,
            I decided to undergo market research and analyse different products.
          </li>
          <li>The assumptions were made by keeping into loop the product owner and peer
            UX designer depending upon time constraints and resource availability.
          </li>
          <li>The enhancement was prioritized from the business based on the rising number of complains, but there was no concrete data available.
            We are in the process of integrating google analytics to the product to measure success more quantitatively.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h6 class='pt-1'>Learnings</h6>
        <ul>
          <li>
            I followed a path of iterative feedback by sharing the design -
            first with the developers, then internal stakeholders and finally with external stakeholders.
            The feedback from my power users gave me confidence to validate my concept and
            cater edge cases.
          </li>
          <li>Since suggestions and feedback were welcomed from the various teams in the early design process, this promoted the feeling of being 'heard' and, consequently, improved 'confidence' among the cross-functional teams.</li>
          <li>The process of iterative feedback proved to be productive as it saved a lot of development time at the end.
