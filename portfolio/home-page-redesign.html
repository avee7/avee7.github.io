        <h2>Case Study</h2>
        <p>The aim of the project was to redesign the home page of Mendeley 
          which would help the users to understand the new value proposition of Mendeley in a clear and simplified way.
        </p>
        <p>
          The project also aimed at benchmarking some of the metrics like perception of trust, content clarity, etc.
          The development for the redesign will take place in Q2 2023.

            The project started with discussions with the UX lead to understand the scope and context of the project.
            We wanted to utilise the opportunity of tech rewrite to redesign the home page. The current home page was outdated and didn't 
            reflect the true value proposition of Mendeley. </p>

          <p>
              Before diving deep into the project, I built a plan and discussed further steps with the UX lead.
              Any change in the information architecture of the website was out of scope for this project.
          </p>  
          <p>Alongwith the UX lead, I designed the format of the initial workshop with the stakeholders to gather insights and understand the value proposition.

            I analysed the existing website and documented the user flows. This highlighted some problem areas. Initially, the project was for all the 
            landing pages on mendeley.com but later we scoped it down to the home page.
          </p>
          <p>
            I analysed the home pages of some of the competitors such as EndNote, Zotero, Sciwheel, FlowCite, etc. Also analysed home pages of some popular websites, such as, Notion, EndNote, Atlassian, Shopify, Grammarly, Airtable, Dovetail.
            This helped me to understand how do various companies structure their home page, how do they commnicate their value proposition and how do they enhance the perception of trust.

            I facilitated a design session with the stakeholders from business, product, analytics, design and marketing teams.
            I also presented the findings of analysis of the existing flows, highlighted the problematic areas and shared the common

            We got major insights from our colleagues from marketing and analytics team which helped us to define the focus areas of the home page.

          <h5 class="pt-2">Design ideation</h5>
          <p>
            After the initial discussion with major key stakeholders, I began the design studios with the 
            design team. With the value proposition in mind, we brainstormed ideas and came up with 
            multiple concepts.

          <h5>Refining concepts</h5>
          <p>
            By incorporating the various ideas from the design ideation workshop and running competitor analysis earlier, 
            I came up with different concepts for the home page.
          </p>
          <p>
            Presented it to the design team and then to the stakeholders for feedback. The usability and accessibility
            drove our major decisions throughout the design process.
            Once the teams were 
            happy with one concept and were onboarded with the designs, I started preparing for usability 
            testing for these concepts.

          <h4>User research</h4>
          <h5 class="pt-2">Planning user research</h5>
          <p>In Mendeley, the process of moderated user research is very well-versed and robust. We have been 
            doing it since ages and the process is very matured. But for the home page project, I wanted to try 
            an approach that would give us a variety of the user feedback.
          </p>
          <p>So, with a fellow user researcher, we proposed a hybrid approach of qualitative (moderated user sessions) and quantitative (unmoderated testing) user research
            which can be run in parallel.
          </p>
          <p>
            At that time, Elsevier was in the process of testing various unmoderated user testing tools to 
            finalise which tool they could buy. 
            This also gave us a chance to contribute to the 
            ongoing trials and we got free trial for an extended period. We used Ballpark to carry out the unmoderated user testing.

          <h5 class='pt-1'>Unmoderated User testing</h5>
          <p>Whilst the moderated user testing sessions were taking place, I created an unmoderated user test
             using ballpark. The aim was to:
          </p>
          <ul class="list-items">
            <li>Evaluate clarity of the Mendeley value propositions</li>

            <li>Rate perception of usefulness of content and brand trust</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The unmoderated test comprised 5-second test, first click test 
            and first impressions test. We got 20 responses from our experiment.

          <h5>Moderated Remote User testing</h5>
          <p>
            We ran these tests with 6 users. The objectives of the test were:
          </p>
          <ul class="list-items">
            <li>Understand if the value propositions are clearly communicated to the users</li>

            We evaluated the results and then prepared a combined report which was shared with the wider team.
            I refined the designs by including recommendations highlighted from the usability testing.
            Ease of use and accessibility support were
            at the core of these designs.

          <p>
            Since this was a high impact project, we utilised the upcoming round of usability testing.
            After running it through our users, we noticed that our visual appeal ratings have improved. 
            Now the content and image clarity is better as compared to the first iteration. We were happy with the results.

         <p>The home page project has received huge positive feedback from various cross-disciplinary teams and the testing participants. 
          But there were some learnings too. We learnt that there was a scope to improve the quality of the user feedback from unmoderated tests. Although we got many responses from users but most of them were invalid.
          So, there were only 11-12 valid responses (which was a very low number than we expected).

          Also, we could have captured the responses for a longer period of time. 
          <p>Also, for the moderated testing, we could have specifically targeted non-Mendeley users. But the recruitments were done way before, so we had pool of Mendeley users only. We thought that may have affected the ratings a bit.</p>
        <p>
            For the next steps, we will be collaborating with the development team for the implementation of the home page. There are also conversations regarding
            capturing data through adobe analytics to set a benchmark for any future improvements and capturing our conversion data.
